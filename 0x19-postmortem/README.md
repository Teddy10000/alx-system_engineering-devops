#Title:<h1> Postmortem: Web Stack Outage and Service Disruption </h1>

#Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 14:00 UTC - June 10, 2023, 18:00 UTC
Impact: Partial service outage affecting the user authentication system
User Experience: Users experienced difficulties logging into their accounts, leading to a degraded user experience and limited access to services.
Affected Users: Approximately 30% of users were affected during the outage.

#Timeline:

    14:00 UTC: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for high error rates in the user authentication service.
    Investigation: The engineering team immediately began investigating the issue, focusing on the authentication service and the underlying database.
    14:30 UTC: Initial assumption was that the database was experiencing a performance degradation due to increased load.
    Misleading Investigation: The team spent considerable time optimizing database queries and scaling up the database servers to address the perceived load issue.
    16:00 UTC: With no improvement observed, the incident was escalated to the backend infrastructure team for further investigation.
    16:30 UTC: The backend infrastructure team discovered a misconfigured caching layer in front of the authentication service, which was causing invalidation issues.
    Resolution: The misconfigured caching layer was reconfigured, and the authentication service was restarted.

#Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a misconfigured caching layer in front of the authentication service. The cache invalidation mechanism was not functioning correctly, leading to inconsistent data and frequent cache evictions.

#Resolution: 
The misconfigured caching layer was reconfigured to ensure proper cache invalidation. Additionally, the authentication service was restarted to clear any cached data inconsistencies. This resolved the issue and restored normal functionality to the user authentication system.

#Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:

    Implement stricter deployment procedures and automated configuration validation to prevent misconfigurations from being deployed to production.
    Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect caching-related issues and promptly alert the team.
    Implement automated tests and validation procedures to ensure cache invalidation mechanisms are functioning as intended.

#Tasks to Address the Issue:

    Conduct a thorough review of the caching layer configuration and establish best practices for cache management.
    Update the deployment pipeline to include validation checks for caching configuration parameters.
    Enhance monitoring systems to include specific alerts for cache invalidation issues.
    Develop and implement automated tests to validate cache invalidation mechanisms during the deployment process.

#Conclusion:
The web stack outage and service disruption were caused by a misconfigured caching layer, which resulted in inconsistent data and cache evictions. The incident was resolved by reconfiguring the caching layer and restarting the affected service. To prevent similar incidents in the future, corrective measures will be implemented, including stricter deployment procedures, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and automated tests for cache invalidation mechanisms.
